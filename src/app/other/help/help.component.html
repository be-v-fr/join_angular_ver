    <h3>What is Join?</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="light-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
        tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
        their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        <br /><br />Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly
        effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
        maximize efficiency (or flow).
        <span class="light-blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban
        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
        visual interface.
        <br /><br />It is important to note that
        <span class="light-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
        exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
        strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

    <h3>How to use it</h3>
    <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="light-blue">Join</span>:

    <ol>
        <li>
            <div class="li-content">
                <h4>Exploring the board</h4>
                When you log in to <span class="light-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a
                default board. This board represents your project and contains
                four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                "Done".
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="li-content">
                <h4>Creating contacts</h4>
                In <span class="light-blue">Join</span>,
                you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
                required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="li-content">
                <h4>Adding cards</h4>
                Now that you've added your contacts,
                you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
                description, due date, assignees, etc.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="li-content">
                <h4>Moving cards</h4>
                As the task moves from one stage to
                another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                dropping the card from one list to another.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="li-content">
                <h4>Deleting cards</h4>
                Once a task is completed, you can
                either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. Remember that
                using <span class="light-blue">Join</span> effectively requires
                consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
                reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions
